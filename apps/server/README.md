To start the backend server run "yarn compile"
This transpiles the typescript and watches for new changes
Then run "yarn dev"
This starts the server 
For the sake of time we were unable to integrate the server endpoints with the frontend
However,the endpoints can be tested on postman with  "localhost:3500/employee/signUpEmployee"
as the route url for signing up an employee to the platform
