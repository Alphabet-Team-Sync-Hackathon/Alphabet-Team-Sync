Start the app by running "yarn"  on your local machine.
Then run "yarn dev"
That will install all used dependencies and start the app.
However,if there is any dependency that was not installed,install it manually
by running "yarn add < name of dependency >".
Most likely "react-router-dom" & "jquery" may not be installed automatically,
so just manually install them by running "yarn add jquery" & "yarn add react-router-dom"
Afterwards run "yarn dev" to start the frontend.
